Wifi Comm

	This Project was made for fun. The purpose of this project was to be able to communicate between android devices using microphone and speaker of the phone similar to a normal GSM call, but with a difference that instead of using the GSM  network, we'll be using the shared wifi connection in an organisation. 
	The app should be installed on both the calling and the receiving phones. Once both the phones are connected in same network,they'll be able see each other on the devices list in the initial screen. Select  a device you want to communicate with and press call button. Similar to a GSM call a call screen appear on the receiving end and the user can decide to pick up or reject the call. Once he picks up the call, they will be able to communicate with each other over wifi network similar to GSM call, but with a very clear sound quality.

	This project is just a starting point. There is a room for a lots of improvement in this project. Any suggestions, ideas are always welcome. :-)
